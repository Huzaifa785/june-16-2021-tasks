Difference Between div, article & section tags?
  
section tag ▶ section means that the content inside is grouped (i.e. relates to a single theme), and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page.<br>
div tag ▶ div does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.<br>
article tag ▶ The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute
                 it independently from the rest of the site.
