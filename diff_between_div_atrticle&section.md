Difference Between div, article & section tags?
  
<section> tag ▶ <section> means that the content inside is grouped (i.e. relates to a single theme), and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page.
<div> tag ▶ <div> does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.
<article> tag ▶ The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute
                 it independently from the rest of the site.
